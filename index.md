### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    First ever coding lab that I’ve ever done and that holds
    something important to me.  It was a good introduction to coding in my
    personal opinion because it was something simple that had a payoff that was
    satisfying.  Even if they were simple cout and cin reliant commands,
    being able to come with nothing and create something that did what it was
    supposed to do was cool.

* Lab 8

    This was more of a learning moment for me because I was partnered with someone
    with way more knowledge and dedication to coding than I do.  He was a truly smart
    and wise person because even though my knowledge was nothing compared to his, he
    was understanding and wanted my input anyway.  He made me feel included in the pair
    programming and that was a good perspective to experience

* Lab 9

    I liked this lab because it was also a good learning experience for me because I felt
    the most hands on with this lab compared to the other labs.  Similar to how I felt in
    the 2nd lab, but with more complex functions and knowledge that I’ve gained throughout
    this class.  Also had a very satisfying payoff to see the lab passing.
